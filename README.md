# Portfolio

My beginner portfolio!

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery



## Existing Features


* Home page with clickable navigation to jump to its associated section. 
* Accordion menu to list three latest projects, including technologies used, and a description of each.
* Modal images that will become almost fullscreen when clicked to see a better screensize if user desires
* Working link to google doc resume
* Working links to git-hub account
* AWS photo upload and hosting
* Edit button -user can edit their entries.
* Delete button - user can delete their entries


## Challenges

* New to CSS grid, and though it helped, I still would like to have figured out how to have my name opaque across the entire top row. However, I like how it does that when I do media query-screen size changes. 
* Chose specifically not to have my direct contact information since this will be deployed to the web, and I want to be mindful of privacy. I prefer an email or reach out on LinkedIn. 
* Media query for better screen adaptation.
* The clickable pictures don't always load right away, so I'm not sure if that is a file size issue, or why there is a bit of a delay when clicking.

## WINS

* Remembering and googling CSS/HTML/Javascript/jQuery
* Simple design still worked for what I wanted to do. 
* Reminded me why I don't want to be in design.
